# Tutorial

## Placing blocks

Open the 'Blocks' tab and use the ''||place (block) at ~0 ~0 ~0||'' block to place something where you're standing

```blocks
// @highlight
blocks.place()
'''

## Replacing Blocks

You can use the ''||replace with (block) when block is (block)||'' to change existing blocks.

```blocks
// @highlight
blocks.replace()
'''

## Advice

These two should be the only blocks you need to use whenever you need to use Code Builder in this game. Good luck!
