# Tutorial

## Placing blocks

Open the 'Blocks' tab and use the 'place (block) at ~0 ~0 ~0' block to place something where you're standing

## Replacing Blocks

You can use the 'replace with (block) when block is (block)' to change existing blocks. 

## Advice

These two should be the only blocks you need to use whenever you need to use Code Builder in this game. Good luck!
